Here’s a Python implementation that shows how to impute missing values in a Pandas DataFrame using the mean of each column. This implementation assumes that you have already installed the Pandas library.

```python
import pandas as pd
import numpy as np

def impute_missing_with_mean(df):
    """
    Impute missing values in a DataFrame with the mean of each column.
    
    Parameters:
    df (pd.DataFrame): The DataFrame with missing values.

    Returns:
    pd.DataFrame: A DataFrame with missing values filled with column means.
    """
    # Copy the original DataFrame to avoid modifying it directly
    df_imputed = df.copy()
    
    # Loop through each column
    for column in df_imputed.columns:
        # Check if the column is numeric
        if pd.api.types.is_numeric_dtype(df_imputed[column]):
            # Calculate the mean of the column excluding NaN values
            column_mean = df_imputed[column].mean()
            # Fill missing values with the calculated mean
            df_imputed[column].fillna(column_mean, inplace=True)
    
    return df_imputed

# Example Usage
if __name__ == "__main__":
    # Create a sample DataFrame with missing values
    data = {
        'A': [1, 2, np.nan, 4],
        'B': [5, np.nan, np.nan, 8],
        'C': [np.nan, 10, 11, 12]
    }
    df = pd.DataFrame(data)
    
    print("Original DataFrame:")
    print(df)
    
    imputed_df = impute_missing_with_mean(df)
    
    print("\nDataFrame after imputing missing values with mean:")
    print(imputed_df)
```

### Explanation
- The function `impute_missing_with_mean` takes a Pandas DataFrame as input and returns a new DataFrame where the missing values are filled with the mean of their respective columns.
- The function first creates a copy of the original DataFrame to avoid modifying it directly.
- It then iterates through each column, checks if it is numeric, calculates the mean, and fills any missing values with that mean.
- Finally, an example usage is provided, which demonstrates how to create a DataFrame with missing values and impute those values with the mean.
