Here's a refined version of the code implementing the recommendations from the critique:

```python
import pandas as pd
import numpy as np

def impute_missing_with_mean(df: pd.DataFrame) -> pd.DataFrame:
    """
    Impute missing values in a DataFrame with the mean of each numeric column.

    Parameters:
    df (pd.DataFrame): The DataFrame with missing values.

    Returns:
    pd.DataFrame: A DataFrame with missing values filled with column means.

    Example:
        Input: 
        df = pd.DataFrame({'A': [1, 2, np.nan, 4], 'B': [5, np.nan, 7, 8]})
        Result: 
        pd.DataFrame({'A': [1.0, 2.0, 2.3333, 4.0], 'B': [5.0, 6.6667, 7.0, 8.0]})
    """
    # Verify DataFrame consists of numeric columns only
    if not all(pd.api.types.is_numeric_dtype(df[col]) for col in df.columns):
        raise ValueError("DataFrame contains non-numeric column(s). Please remove non-numeric data before imputation.")

    # Copy the original DataFrame to avoid modifying it directly
    df_imputed = df.copy()

    # Fill missing values with the mean for numeric columns directly
    df_imputed = df_imputed.fillna(df_imputed.mean())

    return df_imputed

# Example Usage
if __name__ == "__main__":
    # Create a sample DataFrame with missing values
    data = {
        'A': [1, 2, np.nan, 4],
        'B': [5, np.nan, 7, 8],
        'C': [np.nan, 10, 11, 12]  # C is numeric, included for demonstration
    }
    df = pd.DataFrame(data)

    print("Original DataFrame:")
    print(df)

    imputed_df = impute_missing_with_mean(df)

    print("\nDataFrame after imputing missing values with mean:")
    print(imputed_df)
```

### Changes Made:
1. **Argument and Return Type Specification**: Added type hints to the function signature for better clarity on the expected input and output types.
  
2. **Non-Numeric Column Check**: A check has been introduced to raise an exception if non-numeric columns are detected, guiding users to correct their input data.

3. **Direct Mean Imputation**: Removed the explicit loop for better readability and performance by using Pandas' built-in capabilities directly with `fillna()`.

4. **Detailed Example**: An updated docstring now includes an example of the input and expected output, demonstrating how a DataFrame would look after processing.

### Opinion on Code Quality:
This revised implementation improves upon the original by enhancing the robustness and readability of the code while adhering to best practices. The clarifications on input constraints and the use of type hints make the function user-friendly and self-documenting. Overall, these improvements contribute to maintainability and effectiveness, especially for larger datasets where performance considerations become paramount. The implementation is now more versatile and less prone to errors with varying input types.
