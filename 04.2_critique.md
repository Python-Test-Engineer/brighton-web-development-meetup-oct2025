Your implementation of imputing missing values in a Pandas DataFrame using the mean of each column is well-structured, clear, and follows good programming practices. The code is clean and the inline commentary aids in understanding the steps. Here are some specific critiques and recommendations to further improve the code:

### Critique:

1. **Function Naming**:
   - The function name `impute_missing_values_with_mean` is slightly long. While it is descriptive, consider using a shorter name such as `impute_mean` to simplify it, while still conveying the purpose.

2. **Documentation**:
   - The docstring is detailed, which is excellent, but could be even more informative by mentioning if the input DataFrame might contain non-numeric columns, and how they will be handled (they will be ignored since `.mean()` only applies to numeric data).
   - It would also be beneficial to clarify that imputing with the mean could potentially introduce bias in some datasets, depending on the nature of the missing data.

3. **Return Type Mention in Docstring**:
   - In the 'Returns' section of the docstring, explicitly state that the returned DataFrame retains the original DataFrame's indices, since this is an important detail for users.

4. **DataFrame Copy**:
   - The original DataFrame remains unmodified, which is good practice. However, it might be useful to explicitly create a copy of the DataFrame at the beginning:

     ```python
     imputed_dataframe = dataframe.copy()
     ```

   - This ensures that any future modifications to `imputed_dataframe` do not affect the original DataFrame inadvertently.

5. **Error Handling**:
   - The current error handling only checks if the input is a DataFrame. You might want to include checks for empty DataFrames or ones that contain all NaN values, since these would make computing mean values impossible.

### Recommendations:

1. **Imputation Strategy Flexibility**:
   - Consider adding functionality to choose different imputation strategies (e.g., median or mode) via a parameter to make the function more versatile. 

   ```python
   def impute_missing_values(dataframe, strategy='mean'):
       ...
       if strategy == 'mean':
           means = dataframe.mean()
       elif strategy == 'median':
           means = dataframe.median()
       elif strategy == 'mode':
           means = dataframe.mode().iloc[0]  # Assume mode returns a DataFrame
       ...
   ```

2. **Testing**:
   - Add a set of unit tests to verify the functionality of your code. Testing various scenarios with different DataFrame configurations (e.g., all values missing in a column) can help ensure robustness.

3. **Handling Non-Numeric Columns**:
   - If you want to extend this function to handle mixed data types (if applicable), you could filter the DataFrame to only compute means for numeric columns:

   ```python
   numeric_df = dataframe.select_dtypes(include=[np.number])
   means = numeric_df.mean()
   ```

4. **Visualizations**:
   - For comprehensive data analysis, consider integrating a visualization step that shows the proportion of missing data in the DataFrame before and after imputation. This allows users to see the impact of missing data and the imputation process visually.

### Example Implementation with Recommendations:

Here’s how you could integrate some of the proposed changes:

```python
def impute_missing_values(dataframe, strategy='mean'):
    if not isinstance(dataframe, pd.DataFrame) or dataframe.empty:
        raise ValueError("Input must be a non-empty Pandas DataFrame")

    numeric_df = dataframe.select_dtypes(include=[np.number])  # Focusing on numeric data
    if numeric_df.empty:
        raise ValueError("DataFrame contains no numeric columns")

    if strategy == 'mean':
        means = numeric_df.mean()
    elif strategy == 'median':
        means = numeric_df.median()
    elif strategy == 'mode':
        means = numeric_df.mode().iloc[0]  # Gets the first mode
    else:
        raise ValueError("Unknown strategy. Use 'mean', 'median', or 'mode'.")

    imputed_dataframe = dataframe.copy()  # Ensure original DataFrame is not modified.
    imputed_dataframe.fillna(means, inplace=True)  # Fill in place for better performance.
    
    return imputed_dataframe
```

Overall, your implementation is solid, and with these tweaks, you can enhance robustness, flexibility, and clarity. Great job!
