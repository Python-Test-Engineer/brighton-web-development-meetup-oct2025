Your implementation for imputing missing values in a DataFrame using the mean of each column is clear and effectively demonstrates the process. Below are some critiques along with recommendations for improvement:

### Critique and Recommendations:

1. **Documentation**: 
   - Your function is well-documented with a clear docstring, which is excellent. Consider adding an example of input and output to the docstring to enhance understanding.

2. **Handling Labels**:
   - While your code works well with purely numerical DataFrames, it's good to explicitly mention or ensure that the DataFrame passed does not contain categorical data. Users may sometimes attempt to include non-numeric types thinking they will be handled.
   
3. **Using `inplace`**: 
   - The use of `inplace=True` in `fillna()` can lead to chained assignments, which may produce setting with copy warnings in some scenarios. Instead, consider returning the filled values directly:
     ```python
     df_imputed[column] = df_imputed[column].fillna(column_mean)
     ```

4. **Performance Considerations**:
   - If your DataFrame is large, iterating through columns could introduce some performance overhead. Although `fillna()` is vectorized and optimized, consider using the `DataFrame.fillna()` method with computed means directly for better performance:
     ```python
     df_imputed = df.fillna(df.mean())
     ```
   - This approach maintains readability and reduces the complexity of the code.

5. **Usage of `np.nan`**: 
   - Your example uses `np.nan`, which is standard. Make sure to clarify in comments that `np.nan` represents missing values. It's good to remind users that `None`, `float('nan')`, or other missing value representations will not be handled unless filtered prior.

6. **Testing with More Cases**:
   - It's useful sometimes to provide test cases or further examples, including edge cases (e.g., all values are NaN in a column, mixed types, etc.) to showcase robustness. 

7. **Return Type**: 
   - Consider explicitly specifying the return type as `pd.DataFrame` in your return statement to make the type clearer to users quickly.

### Example Adjusted Code
Here’s a slightly refactored version of your function implementing some of the suggestions:

```python
import pandas as pd
import numpy as np

def impute_missing_with_mean(df):
    """
    Impute missing values in a DataFrame with the mean of each numeric column.
    
    Parameters:
    df (pd.DataFrame): The DataFrame with missing values.

    Returns:
    pd.DataFrame: A DataFrame with missing values filled with column means.
    
    Example:
        Input: 
        df = pd.DataFrame({'A': [1, 2, np.nan, 4], 'B': [5, np.nan, 7, 8]})
        Result: 
        pd.DataFrame({'A': [1, 2, 2.3333, 4], 'B': [5, 6.6666, 7, 8]})
    """
    # Copy the original DataFrame to avoid modifying it directly
    df_imputed = df.copy()

    # Fill missing values with the mean for numeric columns directly
    df_imputed.fillna(df_imputed.mean(), inplace=True)

    return df_imputed
```

### Summary
Your implementation is solid, and the suggested changes will improve both performance and maintainability. Keep up the good work, and consider the recommendations to improve general robustness and usability of your function!
